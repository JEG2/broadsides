Broadsides
==========

The game of Broadsides, perhaps more commonly known as Battleship, was played on pen and paper long before there was a commercial board game.  The game is very simple:

* Both player arrange ships of various length on their board where only they can see them
* Players take turns calling out shot coordinates and their opponent tells them if they have hit or missed a ship at those coordinates
* The first player to sink all of the opponent's ships is the winner

There are some minor variations to the game, mainly revolving around how many shots you get each turn.  For our purposes, we will say you receive one shot per ship, expect for the biggest ship (length five) which gives you two shots.  You must declare all shots before you can learn which shots hit and which miss.
